# Garbage Classification Model
This repository is set up to hold ENEL645 Assignment 1-5 deliverables and source code.  

Since the series of assignments will focus on one topic, it is possible that we can develop
something amazing, we may use this repo to showcase and add it into our portfolio when finished.
